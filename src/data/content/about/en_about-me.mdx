Hello, I'm Mat√≠as Vallejos, a software developer from Argentina üá¶üá∑. My journey began with the dream of becoming a footballer, a dream that, although it didn't materialize, taught me resilience, adaptability, and the value of teamwork. These qualities were crucial when I discovered my passion for technology and programming, my true calling.

Although I haven't had the opportunity to work in a company, I have accumulated practical experience with +70 stars received in my open-source projects on GitHub. Among them, Desaf√≠o Planeta stands out, a video game developed in collaboration with the organization Manos Verdes to promote environmental awareness, a project from my career in Virtual Simulations and Video Games.

In my education, web development served as a bridge to transform ideas into realities, using technologies such as Python, Django, JavaScript, React, and Next.js. I have a solid knowledge of SQL databases and cloud tools like AWS, allowing me to implement functional projects.

I am proud of my portfolio piece Minimalist, a web-based task management application, efficient and elegant, incorporating social authentication, OAuth2, NextAuth, and developed under the TDD approach. It uses Django Rest Framework and is hosted on Vercel, combining a Rest API with a PostgreSQL database for an optimized user experience.

I am fascinated by emerging technology trends like web3, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and artificial intelligence, fields that are redefining our digital and economic landscape. I am committed to innovation and exploration in these areas.

From the pitch to the code, my transition from footballer to programmer has been a journey of constant curiosity and strategic vision. This journey, far from over, reflects my life philosophy and my commitment to advancing technological capitalism in Argentina.
